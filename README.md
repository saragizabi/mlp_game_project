## Final Documentation

For our midterm project, we were able to create a My Little Pony themed quest game called Harmony Meadows: Cutie Quest. In this game, the user is first met with the start screen, where they are able to select their own pony design out of 9 options using an HTML select element. Upon clicking the “Start Game” button, the player will be taken into a pony village where they may meet with 3 of the villagers by walking up to them. Each of these villagers assigns the player with a specific quest for the player to complete. Each of these quests is presented in the form of a mini-game and there is a timer implemented for each game that counts how long it takes for the user to complete the game. The objective is to receive a cutie mark after completing all the mini games. The cutie mark the player receives is decided using the combined performance of all 3 mini-games. The first mini-game we built is an apple-picking game that is given to the player by the pony villager Applejack. The objective of the game is to pick 15 apples while having to dodge Apple Bloom, Applejack’s little sister, who runs across the screen, blocking the player’s path. For this game, the user controls a character using WASD keys, which allows the character to move around in order to collect apples and avoid the enemy. The apples spawn at random x-coordinates and slowly fall to the ground; if any apple is missed by the user and falls to the ground, it will respawn at another random x-coordinate and repeat its falling behavior. During the game, Apple Bloom from the right of the screen to the left of the screen in order to throw the player off. If she has run off the screen without hitting the user, she will respawn at a different y-location at a randomly generated speed. If the user does run into the enemy, or Apple Bloom, they will lose about 1 to 3 points, setting them back in the game and making it more challenging, however, the game logic is designed so that the user’s points will never fall below 0. Lastly, the game will have a timer where it will measure how long it takes for the user to successfully collect 15 apples, deciding the score of the game. The second game we built is a memory game that is given to the player by the pony villager Twilight Sparkle. The objective of this game is to match all the cards as quickly as possible. In total, there are 12 cards and 6 pairs of sets. To play the game, the user must click on the back of any card to flip it and see the hidden image on the other side. The user must then continuously try to guess which card out of the leftover 11 cards contains the matching image. If the user picks two cards that do not match, there will be a 2 to 3 second delay where the player can look at the card image and positioning before the card flips back over again. Alternatively, if the user picks two matching cards correctly, the cards will remain flipped over to their image. Lastly, the game will also be timed to measure how long it takes for the player to successfully match all the cards. For our last game, we decided to implement an animal round-up game that is given to the user by pony villager Fluttershy. In this game, the user must push a variety of animals using their mouse to the center of the screen where there is a barrel for them to go into. If the user catches the animal in the barrel, they get one point and another animal respawns somewhere random. The animals are programmed so that they actively avoid the center of the screen and run away when the user comes near them. Furthermore, they can never go past the edge of the screen and are constrained to a specific portion of the screen. The player only has 30 seconds to collect as many animals as they can, which is what decides their score. After the user completes all these games and has all of their scores, which are all saved in local storage, they will receive a cutie mark that is based off of these three scores. After they have received the cutie mark, the game ends.
