* This is a shared workspace for your midterm project group.
* You are welcome to use it as a collaborative space to develop your project, though this isn't required if you would like to develop locally.
* Code written here is automatically saved, and the workspace supports multiple concurrent authors.
* At any time you can use the "..." button to access the "replay" feature to go back and see any changes that were made by another group member.
* You can view your project using a web preview by clicking the "globe" icon in the toolbar above.
* Please use this space to share code with me as needed.
* You will also be posting project updates using the "Lessons" tool.
